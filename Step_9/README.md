A hole appears in the photos where a positive battery terminal should be. There is no need to make this hole!
This issue arose because I reshot some of the photos at a much later date and damaged the holder in the process. :-/ 
I also accidently flip the battery holder in the photos from this moment on. Keep to the improved diagram and everything should work out well!
